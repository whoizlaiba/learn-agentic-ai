**Summary: OpenAI Agents SDK & Swarm Framework**
OpenAI's Swarm was an experimental framework aimed at lightweight and ergonomic orchestration of multi-agent systems. It introduced key concepts like Agents, which are task-specific entities with tools and instructions, and Handoffs, which enable seamless transfer of control between agents. Swarm focused on flexibility and simplicity, making it easy to build scalable and testable AI systems.

Building on these ideas, OpenAI released the Agents SDK, a production-ready toolkit that enhances multi-agent coordination. It allows developers to orchestrate workflows across multiple specialized agents effectively.

The Agents SDK also aligns with several design patterns proposed by Anthropic, including:

- Prompt Chaining: Breaking tasks into step-by-step workflows.

- Routing: Directing tasks to the most suitable agent.

- Parallelization: Running subtasks concurrently.

- Orchestrator-Workers: Central agent assigns work to specialized agents.

- Evaluator-Optimizer: Continuous improvement through evaluation and feedback.

Together, these patterns enable the creation of robust, collaborative AI systems capable of handling complex tasks efficiently.
