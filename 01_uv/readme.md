# 📦 ***Python UV: The Ultimate Guide to the Fastest Python Package Manager***

***UV*** is a ***lightning-fast*** Python package manager designed to simplify and speed up Python development. It handles dependency management, project initialization, and script execution — all through a streamlined CLI.

---

## 🚀 ***Features***

* ***Blazing fast*** dependency resolution & installation
* ***Built-in script runner***
* ***Seamless project initialization***
* ***CLI-first experience***
* ***Native support for packaged applications***

## 🎯 ***Usage Guidelines***

> ✅ ***Rule:*** ***Always use `uv` as the package manager for Python projects.***

### 🔧 ***Create a New Project***

To start a new ***packaged*** application (e.g., a CLI tool or a library):

```bash
uv init --package example-pkg
```

This creates a structured package setup, ready for development and publishing.

### ➕ ***Add Dependencies***

To add a dependency (e.g., `crewai`) to your project:

```bash
uv add crewai
```

## 📁 ***When to Use Packaged Applications***

Use the `--package` flag in `uv init` when your use-case involves:

* ***Publishing to PyPI***
* ***Defining and organizing tests***
* ***Creating CLI tools or reusable modules***

---

## 📌 ***Best Practices***

* ***Prefer CLI commands*** (like `uv add`) for managing dependencies instead of manually editing files.
* ***Maintain clean, modular project structure*** using `uv init --package`.
